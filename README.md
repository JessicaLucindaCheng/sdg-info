# SDG-Info

This repo houses all the images needed for the SDGs and all text for goals, targets and indicators. 

SDG-info is a project of Hack for LA. Hack for LA is a project of Civic Tech Structure, Inc 501(c)(3).

### Project context

Hack for LA is aligning projects with SDGs.  In order to do that we need a central repository to store all the SDG info, so that we can access it on various projects.

### Technology used (WIP)

- Each platform or framework should get its own bullet.
- Each platform should include an [active link](#) to the official documentation.
